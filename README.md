# Git In My Own Words
__---__

## What is Git?
Git is a VCS that is a very useful tool for tracking and editing code, as well as convenient collaboration. It is used for tracking changes without impacting the main code, so you can test out ideas with others safely. Git is used by expert coders for their websites, games, and anything they're working on. It is known for being easy to use and widely accessible by coders of all kinds.

## What am I Curious about?
Git can be confusing at first. For me specifically, I wonder how Git projects connect to the wider internet. For example, if I were to, I don't know just hypothetically, make a website for selling snails, how would the changes I make on Git translate to that website? How do I connect Git files to other projects, and how to I make the website look the way I want it to? Are there some things I have to edit on the website itself instead of Git? Can Git works be connected to something like Google Sites?
